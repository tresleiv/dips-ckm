A provisional diagnosis is used to set in motion the first stage of treatment and management and may be revised as needed, until a formal diagnosis is confirmed.

This archetype is purposefully designed as a separate concept to the Problem/Diagnosis archetype to ensure that initial, working, or unconfirmed, diagnoses are not mixed with confirmed diagnoses and perpetuated as part of ongoing shared problem lists.">
